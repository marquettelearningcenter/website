**Why choose MLC?**

We have loads of fun at Marquette Learning Center. Here are a few reasons why…

**Our curriculum:** We use the Creative Curriculum for lesson plans and ideas. Each classroom has a curriculum they follow that is age appropriate for their room. Lesson plans are changed every week with new activities and toys.

**Structured Schedule:** We have a structured schedule that is made for each room’s age and development. Our schedule includes breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, center time, free play, music, nap time and outside time.

**Brightwheel:** We use an app called Brightwheel to communicate with parents about their child’s day.  Each diaper change, meal, picture, video, note, and naps are logged in Brightwheel and sent immediately to the parent of the child. Parents can contact the teacher directly using the messaging part of the app.

**Music Program:** We have the only “Music Together” program in the state here at MLC. “Music Together” is a program tailored to each age group with actions and music. We have this program once a week during the school year.

**Story Time:** Our librarian from the community library comes every Wednesday at 10:30 am to read stories to us during the school year. During the summer, we go to the library for the Summer Reading Program.

**D.A.R.E.:** We have an exciting 8-week program to help teach children about emergencies, how to read traffic signs, safe practices for non-food items and learn key terms such as crosswalk, trusted adult, feelings, and respect.

**Adopt a grandparent:** During the summer when our school age children are here, we go to our nursing home, Riverview Estates, and play games and visit with them. We do this once a week.

**Swimming and Lessons:** We go swimming every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the summer with our school age. During the first two weeks of July, we bring children ages 3 and up to swim lessons at the local pool.

**Church Lunches:** Our community is lucky enough to have the Free Summer Lunch Program. We walk to the Elim Lutheran Church everyday at noon.

**Vacation Bible School:** We take our 3-year-olds and school age children to VBS the first week of June.
